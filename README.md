# Garrett Post
## About Me
My name is Garrett! I'm a Computer Science and FinTech student at Virginia Tech `Go Hokies`.

After school, I'd like to pursue a career in software development because I really enjoy building things that people actually use. Currently, I build things on the side whenever I have a need that I can't find a solution for.

## Current Projects
### [Public Software Project](https://github.com/Public-Software-Project)
Building apps for users by users. The goal is to make a suite of high quality open source apps for the future. They'll be able to download, use, contribute to, and improve these apps for free. To enable secure syncing, users can run one, easy to set up server at home and let it run their apps for free. If they don't want to do that, we're also working on hosting for users that don't have the ability or means to host their own.

### [Reformify](https://github.com/gpossst/reformify)
The fix for having to set up your own backend when all you want is a simple form. Perfect for feedback and contact forms! Allows for a simplified form viewing, export, and development experience. Coming soon... ðŸ‘€

### Internships
I'm currently spending most of my time applying to internships and practicing [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/gpossst/) problems for assessments and interviews. It's all super nerve-racking, but if you want to get in contact with me, contact me at gpost@vt.edu.

## Skills
**_Languages:_** Python `Intermediate`, Java `Intermediate`, Swift `Intermediate`, TypeScript `Intermediate`, JavaScript `Advanced`, HTML `Advanced`, CSS `Advanced`

**_Technologies:_** React, React Native, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SwiftUI, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Auth0

# Everything Else
**_Contact:_** The best way to get in contact with me is through one of the social medias I have listed to the left. I'm more likely to check Instagram.

**_Private Repos:_** If code is private, that's to ensure the security of a project. In some cases the repository holds the code for a project developed for a company, so it's probably best I keep those private.
