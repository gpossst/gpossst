My name is Garrett Post. I'm a Computer Science and Fintech student at Virginia Tech.

After school, I'd like to pursue a career in software development because I really enjoy building things that people actually use. Currently, I build things on the side whenever I have a need that I can't find a solution for. 

** If code is private, that's to ensure the security of a project. In some cases the repository holds the code for a project developed for a company, so it's probably best I keep that private.
