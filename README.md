## About Me
My name is Garrett! I'm a Computer Science and FinTech student at Virginia Tech `Go Hokies`.

After school, I'd like to pursue a career in software development because I really enjoy building things that people actually use. Currently, I build things on the side whenever I have a need that I can't find a solution for. 

## Current Project
I'm building an app to help me streamline my internship application workflow. Check it out, it's free:

## Everything Else
**_Contact:_** The best way to get in contact with me is through one of the social medias I have listed to the left. I'm more likely to check Instagram.

**_Private Repos:_** If code is private, that's to ensure the security of a project. In some cases the repository holds the code for a project developed for a company, so it's probably best I keep those private.
