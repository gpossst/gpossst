# Garrett Post
## About Me
My name is Garrett! I'm a Computer Science and FinTech student at Virginia Tech.

`Go Hokies` `Go Birds` `Go Os` `Go Celts`

After school, I'd like to pursue a career in software development because I really enjoy building things that people actually use. Currently, I build things on the side whenever I have a need that I can't find a solution for. 

## Current Projects
### [Playlist Transfers](https://playlisttransfers.app)
A web app for transferring playlists from one streaming service to another. It uses APIs from services like Spotify and Apple Music while also utilizing a Node.js server that scrapes then processes playlist data.

### [Personal Website](https://garrett.one)
Up to this point, I haven't had a personal website! My next major project is to build something to house everything from coding to photography to link sharing. 

## Skills
**_Languages:_** Python `Intermediate`, Java `Intermediate`, Swift `Intermediate`, TypeScript `Intermediate`, JavaScript `Advanced`, HTML `Advanced`, CSS `Advanced`

**_Technologies:_** React, React Native, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SwiftUI, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Auth0

# Everything Else
**_Contact:_** The best way to get in contact with me is through one of the social medias I have listed to the left. I'm more likely to check Instagram.

**_Private Repos:_** If code is private, that's to ensure the security of a project. In some cases the repository holds the code for a project developed for a company, so it's probably best I keep those private.
